I am created to help you so there's a list of commands I am able to do:
1. /add - allows you to push some new tasks in your To Do List. Each row will be a new task here.
2. Start - starts tracking the time till now. You can't do multiple tasks the same time in the case you're not Julius Caesar.
Otherwise, contact @sasha_golovach to add this feature.
3. Finish - stops the timer and updates your progress in google calendar.
